# Dynamic README Generator

## Description
For the module 9 challenge, I have created an application that uses prompts to get answers to certain questions and processes those answers to instantly create an organized README.md file containing all the relevant information gained from the user's inputs.

## Usage
In order to use the application, the user must install Node.js on their device, use the commands "npm i inquirer" and "npm i fs" in their command line terminal to install the inquirer and fs packages respectively, then run the application using the command "node index.js"

## Technologies
1. Javascript - provides functionality for prompts, file formatting, and app initialization

2. Node.js - provides framework for testing
